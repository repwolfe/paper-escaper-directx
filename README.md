# Paper Escaper!
## 3D Game for PC - Avoid getting hit by the falling pages!

3D DirectX Game developed by Robbie Wolfe and JP Landry for our third year Game Design course.

The game has the player trapped inside a book, where pages are constantly falling. 
Each page has in it a randomly located hole which allows the player to survive to the next page. 
The goal of the game is to last as long as possible without getting squished by the falling page. 

The game was developed in C++, using the DirectX graphics framework. This was the first 3D game we had made.
The goal was to make the game get harder as time went on, such as making the pages fall faster, but it didn't end up getting implemented.
